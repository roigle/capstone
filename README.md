# capstone
A web application to trade products/services.

This is the sixth and final project for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. Project finished on December 2021. Full specifications can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/final/capstone/

The project is done with Django and JavaScript.

Once registered, users can offer products/services and "buy" products/services from other users. Instead of money, the services are bought with points you earn within the application when other users buy your services.

When posting their products/services, users can add the details (description, price, slots...). They can also edit their services, close them and reopen them (if there are >0 slots).

Users can also edit their profile, and see the things they have on their wishlist, the things they have boughts, and also the things they have sold. Other users can also leave comments and there is a rating system.
